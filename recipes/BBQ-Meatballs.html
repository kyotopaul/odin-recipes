    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sheet pan-baked BBQ meatballs are bursting with all the goodness of the grill. 
            Smoky and tangy, they are perfect on a sub sandwich or just for eating on their own.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef, 20% fat or higher preferred</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup crushed tortilla chips</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons BBQ sauce, or as needed, for basting</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef, egg, tortilla chips, ketchup, brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, oregano, salt, and black pepper to a large bowl. 
                Mix together gently with your hands until evenly combined. 
                Roll mixture into balls, about the size of a golf ball. 
                Place meatballs on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. 
                Remove from the oven and baste with BBQ sauce. 
                Return to the oven and bake about 12 more minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). 
                Serve as desired.</li>
